Lab 9: Battleboats
-----------
I WROTE:(SOLO OPTION)
-Agent.c
-Message.c
-MessageTest.c 
-Negotiation.c (I accidentally did this file)
-----------
DESCRIPTION
In this lab we utilized multiple complex State machines and parsing through tokenization to create, at least in my solo option case, a part of the Battle Boats game. Additionally we created true random numbers and utilized different decoding, encoding, and cryptography to safely send data between two uno's

APROACH
Like usual I go straight to the lab Manuel and try to absorb as much information about the input outputs and functions that I should use as possible. I believe that the lectures going over this lab were more helpful. I had a handful of data errors especially handling alot of stat machines. There were many different error messages that I had to fix. If I were to approach this lab another way I would read the lab Manuel many times because I had to refer to it on numerous occasions, which made the coding process very tedious
-----------
RESULT
The lab ended up working correctly in most functionality. I spent around 45 hours on this lab. I liked the complexity of the lab and how it was very interactive. Additionally it was a great final project to sum up the whole quarter, event though because I choose the solo option, I didn't deal with arrays. I wish there was a whole project that was single and not partnered. Where I can still create the whole project. Also at first I figured out how to do Negotiation.c only to find out I didn't have too. I believe the testing was the hardest. I wasn't able to do create a good Agent but because that compiled without errors. This is why I left it out. If I had more time, I believe I could have figured it out. The difficult of the lab was between a range of 1-10 is 8.5. I believe this is is a good lab though and believe that all topics were discussed in class.
