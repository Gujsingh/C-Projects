Lab 8: Role-Playing Game
-----------
DESCRIPTION
In this lab we parsed through .txt files and navigated to different files according to the contents of the txt files. In doing so we used functions such as FREAD() and FSEEK(). Additionally we learned to create maker files and add targets to them and add a clean function.
-----------
APROACH
Like usual I go straight to the lab Manuel and try to absorb as much information about the input outputs and functions that I should use as possible. I believe that the lectures going over this lab were more helpful. I had a handful of data errors especially handling alot of strings. This caused a lot of debugging. I wouldn't change how I did this lab and would approach it the same way. I like usual worked alone and lonely.
-----------
RESULT
The lab ended up working correctly in all functionality. I spent around 12 hours on the lab. I liked the simplicity of the lab because it still was able to be flooded with content and learning opportunities. The function to parsee through the array was the hardest because I didn't knew that I had to have a copy of roomfuls in my direct directory. The lab Manuel and lectures thoroughly covered the lab. However, I do not remember learning about Fseek and Fread in class.
